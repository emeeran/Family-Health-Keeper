# How to See the Eye Care Module

## Quick Steps to View

The Eye Care Module is **fully integrated** and **working**. Follow these steps to see it:

### 1. Open the App
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Log In
- The app requires authentication
- Use any email and password to log in (demo mode)
- Click "Login"

### 3. Select a Patient
- Once logged in, you'll see the patient list in the left sidebar
- Click on any patient (e.g., "Sarah Johnson", "Michael Chen", etc.)

### 4. Scroll Down in Patient Details
- After selecting a patient, you'll see their details on the right
- **Scroll down** past these sections:
  1. Patient Info (name, avatar)
  2. Health Insights  
  3. Current Medications
  4. Medical History Summary
  5. Reminders
  6. Appointments
  7. **üëÅÔ∏è EYE CARE RECORDS** ‚Üê **IT'S HERE!**

### Visual Markers (Temporary Debug)
To make it easier to find during testing, I've added:
- **Green border** around the entire Eye Care Module
- **Yellow banner** at the top saying "‚ö†Ô∏è EYE CARE MODULE IS HERE ‚ö†Ô∏è"

These debug markers will be removed once you confirm it's visible.

## Module Features

Once you see it, the Eye Care Module has:
- **3 Tabs**: Prescriptions, Tests, Conditions
- **Add buttons** for each type of record
- **Forms** for entering:
  - Eye prescriptions (sphere, cylinder, axis, VA)
  - Eye tests (IOP, findings)
  - Eye conditions (severity, status)

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see a patient list"
- Make sure you logged in successfully
- Check the browser console for errors (F12)

### "The page is empty"
- The app loads mock data automatically after login
- Try refreshing the page (F5)

### "I still don't see the Eye Care Module"
- Make sure you **selected a patient** from the sidebar
- **Scroll all the way down** - it's after Appointments
- Look for the bright green border and yellow banner

## Console Output

Check the browser console (F12) for these messages:
```

üëÅÔ∏è Eye record: [record data] Patient: [patient name]
üé® Rendering with theme: [light/dark] isDark: [true/false]
```

If you see these messages, the component is rendering successfully!
